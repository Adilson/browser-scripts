Browser Scripts
===============

Some useful Grease Monkey scripts for a better experience on websites originally built with no user experience in mind.

You can import anyone of them pasting its content on a new user script created on the "User Scripts" section on the ```about:addons``` if you are using Firefox.

- [Unlocalizer](/unlocalizer): this script allow automatic redirection from a translated content (fr-FR/pt-BR/es-ES, etc) to the original en-US.
